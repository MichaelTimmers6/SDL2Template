# SDL2 Template

This is a general purpose template for any new SDL2 project.

It has a basic event loop that only updates when an event occurs, and a renderer namespace with some helpful functions. 

A bash shell file is provided for Mac that builds the project. It may work on linux if clang++ is supported, otherwise change it to g++ or something else.
